\IEEEPARstart{I}{n} In this section, we present the code generation process using \alphaz\ and key insights into some of our implementation techniques. We discuss formulation of different schedules, implementation of different optimization strategies with the \alphaz, and optimization of matrix max-plus handwritten kernel.
