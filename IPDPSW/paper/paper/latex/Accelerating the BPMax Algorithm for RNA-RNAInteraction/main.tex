\begin{abstract}
RNA-RNA interactions (RRI) play an important role in various biological processes such as gene transcription, and are known to play a critical role in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer’s, necessitating efficient computational tools. To date, RRI programs like BPMax were developed and optimized by hand, and this is prone to human error, and costly to develop and maintain.  Its high complexity ($\Theta(N^3M^3)$ in time and $\Theta(N^2M^2)$ in space) make it both essential and a challenge to parallelize it.   In this paper, we present a parallelization of BPMax on a single shared memory CPU platform.  From a mathematical specification of the dynamic programming algorithm, we generate highly optimized code that achieves over $100\times$ speedup over the baseline program employing a standard ``diagonal-by-diagonal'' execution order. We achieve 76~GFLOPS, which is about a fifth of our platform's peak theoretical single-precision performance for max-plus computation. The main kernel in the algorithm whose complexity is $\Theta(N^3M^3)$ attains 117~GFPLOS. We do this with a polyhedral code generation tool, \alphaz, that takes user-specified mapping directives and automatically generates optimized C code that enhances parallelism and locality.
\alphaz\ allows the user to explore various schedules, memory-maps, and parallelization approaches, as well as tiling of the most dominant part of the computation.


%We make  handwritten C code related to the actual algorithm, except a few compiler directives and minor optimizations of variable initialization.  
%Besides overall speedup, our focus was to optimize the most compute-intensive part of the BPMax program which has complexity of $O(M^3N^3)$.  Our optimization speeds up this portion of the computation by 170x over the base version which is a sequential improvement between $1.4\times$ to $2\times$ over a similar type of kernel optimized previously using polyhedral acceleration on moderate size input sequences.

\section{\uppercase{Introduction}}
Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is the origin of life. It plays an essential role in the coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. RNA is a single strand formed by a sequence of four different types of nucleotides – Adenine (A), Uracil (U), Guanine (G), and Cytosine (C), which form a repeating structure.  Different nucleotides may form bonds of varying strength. A single RNA strand folds into itself. Also, two different RNA strands can interact with each other, resulting in the secondary structure, which can provide valuable  information about a biological function.
%Guanine forms the strongest bond with Cytosine, Adenine forms the next strongest bond with Uracil, and Uracil forms the weakest bond with Guanine. 
%A single RNA strand folds into itself. Also, two different RNA strands can interact with each other, resulting in the secondary structure. Knowledge of such structure can provide useful information about a biological function and may be used in experiments.

%Researchers have long been studying these interactions and proposed different interaction models.  One of the early studies on interactions between nucleotides of single RNA was proposed by Nussinov in 1978 that predicts secondary structure\cite{Nussinov1978}. RNA-RNA interactions have been moved to spotlight in biology since mid 1990s with significant RNA interference discovery. 
Researchers have long been studying these interactions and proposed different models. In 1978, Nussinov presented a model \cite{Nussinov1978} that predicts secondary structure from single RNA folding. RNA-RNA interactions have been moved to the spotlight in biology since the mid-1990s with significant RNA interference discovery. Chitsaz et al.\cite{Chitsaz2009} developed piRNA - one of the most comprehensive thermodynamic models for RRI.  It has an $\Theta(N^4M^2+N^2M^4)$  time and $\Theta(N^4+M^4)$ space complexity, %where $M$ and $N$ is the number of nucleotides present in each RNA sequence.
for sequences of length $M$ and $N$. It uses $96$ dynamic tables.  However, running this compute and memory intensive program is extremely challenging. It takes days and months to get experimental results. So, Ebrahimpour-Boroojeny et al. \cite{EbrahimpourBoroojeny2019}  retreated from the slow comprehensive model and developed the BPPart for base-pair partition and BPMax for base-pair maximization. They use a simplified energy model and consider only base pair counting. Both of them have similar asymptotic time and space complexity of $\Theta(M^3N^3)$  and $\Theta(M^2N^2)$. BPPart uses $11$ tables, and BPMax uses a single one.  Nevertheless, the original implementation of even BPMax suffers from poor performance as the input size grows.

Ebrahimpour-Boroojeny et al. conclude that BPMax \cite{EbrahimpourBoroojeny2019} captures a significant portion of the thermodynamic information. The Pearson and Spearman’s rank correlation between piRNA and BPMax is  $0.904$ at $-180$\textdegree\textit{C} and  $0.836$  at 37\textdegree\textit{C} highlighting its importance.  BPMax and other RRI algorithms such as piRNA~\cite{Chitsaz2009}, IRIS~\cite{Pervouchine2004IRISIR}, RIP~\cite{Huang2009} follow similar recurrence patterns. So, besides the practical usefulness of BPMax, the learning and insights gleaned from this optimization approach can be applied to the other RRI interaction algorithms with similar recurrence patterns.


Performance optimization requires exploiting parallelism and locality at multiple levels. It is a difficult task and often leads to hand-crafted code. Manual optimization is neither easily portable (e.g., to different platforms where different kinds of optimization are needed) nor easily maintainable (e.g., changing the optimization strategy may require changes to many parts of the code). This challenge grows as the complexity of the program increases. It is highly desirable that the highly optimized programs get generated from a simple correct program together with a set of performance tuning hints or directives.

Fortunately, RRI algorithms fit the requirements of the \emph{polyhedral model}~\cite{sanjay-fst-tcs, quinton-jvsp89, feautrier91, feautrier92a, feautrier92b}  - a mathematical formalism that allows for just such program transformations.  The polyhedral compilation has been the subject of intense research for 35~years, and yet, even a state-of-the-art polyhedral tool like PLUTO~\cite{Bondhugula2015PLuToAP, Bondhugula2008} does not yield satisfactory performance~\cite{Varadarajan2016}. Many of the performance optimization strategies need some careful thought by an expert.  This gap can be bridged by a tool that allows semi-automatic transformation like Chill~\cite{Chen08chill:a}. At CSU, we are developing and working with a similar tool, \alphaz~\cite{sanjay-lcpc2012}, that operates at a higher level of abstraction.

The paper proceeds as follows. We first set up the context and background of our work to highlight the BPMax algorithm, discuss the polyhedral model's role, and application of \alphaz\ . Then, we discuss multiple phases of the optimization process, the rationale behind different schedules, processor allocations, and memory mappings. Finally, we go over our performance results and conclude the paper with challenges and future directions.

\section{\uppercase{CONCLUSION}}
This work demonstrates the optimization process of a complete RRI program using polyhedral transformations. Our result shows that the tiling improves the performance of the most dominant part of the computation. However, the inner reductions are still inefficient, which limits the overall performance improvement. Also, the double max-plus operation remains bandwidth-bound even after tiling transformation. This indicates that an additional level of tiling at the register level is required to make the program compute-bound and improve performance.  We also plan to apply tiling on $R_1$ and $R_2$ and distribute the computation over a cluster using  MPI. All these transformations remain a challenge for \alphaz\ , and we hope to overcome them in the future.
